The best way to understand how this component works and how to use it is to review the
`ABSolutions.SvgAssetCollector.Demo.Blazor` project in the [git repo](%GitRepo%). It is a modified standard Blazor demo
site with a dedicated page showing how this component can be used to retrieve an upstream SVG and render it inline as
markup.

While I think the code is pretty easy to follow, I know some people understand better by building things themselves. So,
I'll walk you through the process of building the demo project in the the pages contained in this section. By the end, I
think you'll have a pretty solid idea of how to integrate this component into your own projects.
